= Fireworks Metal Demo

== Overview

This is a graphics demo that shows animated fireworks.   I wrote it for two
reasons: to see what Swift can do, and for something new and fun (I never do
3D graphics in my day job).

This uses the "Metal" low-level 3D graphics API.  Mac OSX 10.11+ is required.

== Features

- 60 FPS (2015 Mac Book)
- Silky smooth "global time" rendering; no step-based ticks with floating point errors.  
- Calculates gravity and air drag
- Uses alpha blending
- Two kinds of fireworks: twinkle out and plume trail

NOTE: Make sure to run it in release mode for lowest CPU use (edit the
scheme).

== Keys

backward by .016 ms.
